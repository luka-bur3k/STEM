[Test vector generation in post silicon verification and validation process]

For this task we tried to make a functional desktop app, but due to technical issues with different OS's on different
devices we were unable to deliver. Our first idea was to use C# & Java in combination with C++ but sadly 2 of our teammates didn't
have the hardware that supports software for that. 

In the end we only came up with a couple of .sql queries for data available in the task, as well as sketches for backend in Java. Sadly nothing is functional nor 
exceptional but we still believe we grew as a team.
