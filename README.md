# STEM

[Test vector generation in post silicon verification and validation process]

For this task we tried to make a functional desktop app, but due to technical issues with different OS's on different
devices we were unable to deliver. Our first idea was to use C# in combination with C++ but sadly 2 of our teammates didn't
have the software for that. 

In the end we only came up with a couple of .sql queries for data available in the task. Sadly nothing is functional nor 
exceptional but we still believe we grew as a team.
